# AI-Virtual-Mouse
This is a project undertaken to create an AI Virtual mouse. Instead of using a traditional Mouse the User can simply hover their finger over their screen to navigate the cursor.

The user uses their index finger to navigate the cursor on their screen, to left click the user will need to bring the tips of their index and middle finger together touching. To right click the user will need to bring the tips of the index and little finger together touching.
